# AI-Powered Telegram Audio Report Generation System

## Project Overview
This project is an application designed to process audio recordings uploaded via Telegram, utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract specific information, and generate a downloadable CSV report. The primary goal is to automate the extraction of structured data from unstructured audio inputs, specifically targeting information like names, addresses, and quantities of items purchased.

## Target Output
The system aims to produce a CSV file with the following columns for each processed audio entry:

- Nama (Name)

- Alamat (Address)

- Jumlah minuman yang di beli (Number of drinks purchased)

## System Architecture
The application is composed of several key components that work together to achieve the desired functionality:

### Telegram Bot Interface:

Serves as the primary user interface for file uploads, status updates, and report delivery.

Handles interactions like /start commands and signals for upload completion (e.g., /done).

Supports various audio file formats (e.g., .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .ogg).

Technologies: Python with python-telegram-bot, Node.js with Telegraf.js.

### Backend Application Server:

The central engine that orchestrates the entire process.

Receives files and commands from the Telegram bot via an API.

Manages a job queue for handling concurrent requests (up to 30 files per user).

Interfaces with audio processing, LLM, and report generation modules.

Handles temporary file storage.

Technologies: Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI), Node.js (Express.js), Java (Spring Boot).

### Audio Processing Module (within Backend):

Converts spoken audio into text (Speech-to-Text - STT).

Technologies: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe, Azure Cognitive Speech Services, OpenAI Whisper, Mozilla DeepSpeech.

### LLM Integration Module (within Backend):

Extracts structured information (Nama, Alamat, Jumlah minuman) from the transcribed text using an LLM.

Involves careful prompt engineering to guide the LLM.

Technologies: OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4), Google Gemini API.

### Report Generation Module (within Backend):

Collects extracted data and formats it into a CSV file with the specified headers.

Technologies: Standard CSV libraries (e.g., Python csv module, Node.js fast-csv).

### Temporary File Storage:

Securely stores uploaded audio files and generated CSV reports during processing.

Technologies: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, Local Server Storage.

### Job Queue System (Recommended):

Manages asynchronous processing of audio files, enhancing scalability and resilience.

Decouples file reception from processing and allows for retries.

Technologies: Redis with Celery (Python), RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka.

```
1. User Upload: User uploads audio files (up to 30) via the Telegram bot and signals completion.

2. Bot to Backend: The bot forwards files and user ID to the backend server.

# Backend Processing (Asynchronous):

- Queuing: Files are added to a job queue.

- Audio-to-Text: Audio is transcribed.

- LLM Extraction: LLM extracts "Nama," "Alamat," and "Jumlah minuman" from the text.

- Data Aggregation: Extracted records are collected.

- Report Generation: A CSV report is created from the aggregated data.

- Notification & Download: The backend notifies the bot, which then sends the CSV file or download link to the user.

- Cleanup (Optional): Old files are deleted from temporary storage.

# Key Considerations
1. LLM Prompt Engineering: Critical for accurate data extraction.

2. Handling Multiple Mentions: Logic to parse multiple entries from a single audio file.

3. Error Handling: Robust mechanisms for all potential failure points.

4. Security: Secure APIs, API key management, and file handling.

5. Scalability: Job queue and cloud services are key.

6. Cost Management: Monitor usage of cloud STT/LLM services.

7. Rate Limiting: Adherence to API limits of Telegram and other services.

8. User Experience (UX): Clear status updates and handling of processing times.
